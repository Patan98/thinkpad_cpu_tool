# Thinkpad CPU tool

## Thinkpad CPU tool
Simple bash script to manage cpu power setting and prevent overheating. <br />

## Idea
The operation of the software is nsure on older Intel processor models (35W and 45W) optimal battery life and variable performance with just one click. <br />
Clearly with the new models, energy performance is already highly optimized, so use is recommended mainly on models with higher consumption. <br />
